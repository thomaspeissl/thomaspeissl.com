Releasing an Android app update is a crucial step for developers in ensuring that their app's users have access to the latest features, improvements, and security patches. If you've built a Progressive Web App (PWA) and want to update its Android version, PWA Builder is an invaluable tool that simplifies the process. In this post, we will delve into the three main steps to release an Android app update with PWA Builder:

## 1. Use an Existing Key with PWABuilder

Before releasing an update, you need to ensure that you're using the same signing key as the original release. PWA Builder provides an option to use an existing key, which is essential for maintaining continuity and ensuring that the update is recognized as a legitimate version of your app.

- Launch PWABuilder and head to the 'Package' section.
- Choose the Android platform.
- Instead of generating a new key, select the option to "Use existing key".
- Upload your previously used key. If you've used PWA Builder for your initial release, you should have the key stored safely.

## 2. Add new "sha256_cert_fingerprints" to .well_known/assetlinks.json

The `assetlinks.json` file is crucial for the Android OS to recognize and verify the relationship between your PWA and its Android counterpart. When you update your app, it's imperative to add the new SHA-256 certificate fingerprint.

- First, obtain the SHA-256 certificate fingerprint from the Android App Signing section in the Google Play Console.
- Next, navigate to your server's `/.well_known/` directory.
- Open `assetlinks.json` and append the new "sha256_cert_fingerprints" to the existing list. Ensure the format remains consistent with previous entries.
- Save the changes and ensure that this file is publicly accessible from your server.

## 3. Release on Google Play

Now that you have prepared the updated package and made necessary changes on your server, it's time to release the update on Google Play.

- Head to the Google Play Console and select your app.
- Navigate to the 'Release' section.
- Upload the updated APK or App Bundle that you generated with PWA Builder.
- Make sure you fill out any necessary information about the update, such as the changes made or new features added.
- Once everything is set, click 'Review Release', and upon ensuring all looks good, hit 'Rollout'.

In conclusion, updating your PWA's Android version need not be a daunting task. With tools like PWA Builder, the process becomes streamlined, ensuring that your users always enjoy the best and most secure version of your app. Keep these steps in mind, and your update release will be a breeze!
