I'm thrilled to announce that my brand-new website, [thomaspeissl.com](https://www.thomaspeissl.com), is now live and ready for exploration! This website has been a labor of love, and I can't wait to share it with you.

## A Commitment to Open Source:

At its core, [thomaspeissl.com](https://www.thomaspeissl.com) embodies the principles of open source. Much like the software and tools I'm passionate about, this website is open source too. You can explore its source code, contribute, and even adapt it for your own projects. The GitHub repository is right here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/thomaspeissl/thomaspeissl.com).

## Powered by GitHub Pages:

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, a fantastic platform for hosting static websites directly from your GitHub repositories. This makes it easy to maintain and update the site as I continue to explore new technologies and ideas.

## Built with Astro Framework:

Under the hood, I've used the [Astro framework](https://astro.build/) to develop this website. Astro is an exciting new static site generator that brings the best of both worlds ‚Äì the developer experience of a modern framework and the speed and performance of a static site. It's been a joy to work with, allowing me to create a fast and efficient website.

## What you'll find on thomaspeissl.com:

On my website, you'll discover a glimpse into my world as a web developer and Linux enthusiast. I'm constantly exploring new tech, diving into Linux adventures, and experimenting with AI. I share my insights, experiences, and projects on the site.

I've also integrated a blog where I'll be posting about my tech explorations, open source contributions, and insights into web development. It's a space where we can learn and grow together in the ever-evolving world of technology.

Thank you for being a part of my tech journey. Together, we'll continue to embrace the exciting possibilities that open source and technology offer.

Stay curious, stay innovative, and let's embark on this journey together! üöÄüåê
